# DC-exercises
This is a general repo to store non-project exercise files from DC Flex Boot Camp

1) canvas-index.html - this file was an example of using the HTML <canvas> tags. 
    The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via scripting (usually JavaScript).
    The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics. You must use a script to actually draw the graphics.
    Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.
    
2) javascript-exercises - folder that contains all exercises used to better understand JavaScript.

3) jQuery - folder that contains all exercises used to learn jQuery.

4) postgreSQL - this folder contains .sql files that were used when learning how to PostgreSQL.  This contains SQL schema setups,
    as well as database read and write queries.
