# DC-exercises
This is a general repo to store non-project exercise files from DC Flex Boot Camp

1) htm_css - folder that contains basis exercises using plain HTML and vanilla CSS3. 

2) canvas-index.html - this file was an example of using the HTML <canvas> tags. 
    The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via scripting (usually JavaScript).
    The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics. You must use a script to actually draw the graphics.
    Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.
    
3) javascript-exercises - folder that contains all exercises used to better understand JavaScript.

4) jQuery - folder that contains all exercises used to learn jQuery.

5) postgreSQL - this folder contains .sql files that were used when learning how to PostgreSQL.  This contains SQL schema setups,
    as well as database read and write queries.
    
6) express-example - this folder contains simple examples of app handling using Express.
    This was written in JavaScript using Express and the use of nodemon.
    Page 1 - "/" outputs "Hello World" after the route is processed through the JavaScript Express app handler.
    Page 2 - "/cats" routes the site to the "/cats" page.  Displays "MEOW".
    Page 3 - "/dogs" routes the site to the "/dogs" page.  Displays "WOOF".
    Page 4 - "/cats" routes the site to the "/cats_and_dogs" page.  Displays "Living together".
    Page 5 - "/greet/:slug" will display a greeting to a user and provide them their birthYear base on information
        provided in the :slug portion of the url.
    Page 6 - "/fav_manga" displays a list of favorite manage after reading the 'favorite:' attribute from the JS object.
